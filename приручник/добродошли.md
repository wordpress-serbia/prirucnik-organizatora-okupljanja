# Welcome

Check out our latest guidelines for in-person events!

If you’re interested in learning more about attending a meetup, organizing a meetup, transferring ownership of a meetup, or joining the WordPress Chapter Meetup program, you’ve come to the right place!

You can find your local meetup here.

## What are Meetups?

Meetups are locally-organized groups that meet for events on a regular basis (commonly once a month) and power year-round WordPress communities.

These events are intended to be relaxed, open to all, and can take many formats:

- presentations/lecture series,
- hackathons,
- social gatherings,
- workshops,
- co-working,
- running a WordPress help desk,
- contributor sprints/drives, and others.

However, anything that brings together 2 or more people to share their WordPress experiences counts — there’s no minimum number of attendees or required format.

## The WordPress Chapter Meetup Program

WordPress has an official Meetup account. WordPress meetup groups that are part of this account receive certain benefits, including having the meetup.com dues paid by the WordPress Community Support, PBC.

Having a meetup group on this account does require following the Five Good Faith Rules that were created by a group of volunteer meetup organizers.

The Five Good Faith Rules include:

- WordPress Meetups are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
- Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
- Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers.
- Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
- Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

We also ask everyone that organizes WordPress Chapter Meetup to uphold the principles of the WordPress open source project, including the GPL. This helps protect the user/attendee, who might not realize that by using a non-GPL plugin or theme, they are giving away the rights that WordPress provides them.

If you’d like to start a new meetup inside the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program or have an existing meetup you’d like to add to it, you can learn more on our Joining the Meetup Chapter Program page.

## A Note About the Quizzes

In the end of some of the handbook pages, you will be presented with a quiz to test your knowledge of the material that we have covered.

The goal is to highlight the important details and help you retain it. You will need to get all of the answers correct in order to pass, but do not worry – you can retake the quizzes as often as you like in order to achieve the 100% pass rate.

To be able to use quizzes, you need to be logged in to your WordPress.org account. In case you don’t already have a valid WordPress.org account, you can create one now.

Finally, all of the quizzes will be at the end of the section, as this example shows.

Good luck with the quizzes, and please use the #community-team channel on our Slack to report if a quiz question is incorrect or ambiguous. If you need to find them later, all of our quizzes live in the WordPress Contributor training site.
